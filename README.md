# RV32i_custom_core
Custom RV32i core that cover 39 instructions except "ecall" and "fence"

- Loading instruction( assembly form) into the imem is more easier with my "RV32i emulation"(one of my project) repos that have a program to turn asm code into psuedo bianry code(in .bin file is representation as hex number).
